/**
 * Purpose: Simple interface to defer memory funcs to the memory watcher. The memory watcher is the concrete
 * implementation for the memory funcs, so implementors of this interface need only define a getter for their memory
 * watcher rather than handle all of the memory funcs which are rather big and difficult to deal with. The memory
 * watcher class does the heavy lifting of tracking stats whilst this interface just wraps around it.
