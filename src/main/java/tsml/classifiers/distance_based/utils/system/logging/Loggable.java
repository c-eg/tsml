 * Purpose: simple interface to get the logger from an implementing class. Each logger is bespoke to an instance of a
 * class, therefore only access to that logger is granted, for the purpose of logging, and setting is not allowed
 * (otherwise we'd be logging from a logger unspecific to our context).
